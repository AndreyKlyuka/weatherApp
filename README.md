# WeatherApp

This little app helps you to know what weather in the city you selected.

### Done like a test task for Intern Frontend position at Steelkiwi.

# Description

The app uses [Openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to get an information about current temperature, min and max values of temperature and weather description.

# How to launch

To use the app just save a repository as a local folder and run the index.html file.

# Technologies that were used and what have been done in all?

The app created with using HTML5, CSS3 and pure JavaScript as a tech stack and API from Openweathermap service.

# What have been done?

Flexbox helps to set a correct central positions of elements until 1020px inclusive. Bigger adaptive requires using media query.
Visual part of site consist of header(search field and weather card), main part(some popular cities and faq) and footer.

Script added to link visual part and some data about weather from API. It does a search request for cities and then user select one of them script does the second request to get information about weather. Information displayed in the cart in header.

# What need to do better?

* Add responsibility for mobiles and tablets, use media.
* Add animations for modals.

# Difficulties in development

The hardest part was to create a transition to a mobile version, it took a lot of time trying to do this. The problem was not in creating a layout, but in using media queries due to little experience with them ( it was not so hard to create desktop part) and a small amount of time chosen as the deadline.
Also, there is a problem with arrow which open and close faq text, they open at the second click and work properly after this.

Anyway, i want to continue working on this project and complete all tasks, for improving my skills in creating responsive apps.
