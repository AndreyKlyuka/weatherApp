# What need to do better?

* Add responsibility for mobiles and tablets, use media.
* Add animations for modals.

# Difficulties in development

The hardest part was to create a transition to a mobile version, it took a lot of time. The problem was not in creating a layout, but in using media queries due to little experience with them ( it was not so hard to create desktop part) and a small amount of time chosen as the deadline.
